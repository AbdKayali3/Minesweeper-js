#### Made under 2 hours as a challenge


Minesweeper is an old game and I tried to recreate it in such a small amount of time as a challenge.
> Accurding to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)),  Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle video game. The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" or bombs without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field. The game originates from the 1960s.
